Minutes of the meeting

- Our seventh official meetup is jam-packed with new faces and new features.
- Backstage maintainers tidy up and close out some RFCs.
- Then, we hear about all the latest additions to Backstage Search. When we released the new and improved Backstage Search platform, it shipped with Lunr as the default search engine. Since then, the community has been busy adding support for two more search engine options for you to choose from:
  - PostgreSQL-based search: SDA SE presents their database-backed approach to search, which features simple setup and short boot times.
  - Elasticsearch: Roadie.io demos this highly requested and popular search option, which gives you greater scalability and better query language options.
- Plus, the return of Splunk — and even more demos!
- AWS S3 URL Reader: Splunk extends support for reading from AWS buckets in Backstage.
- XCMetrics plugin (https://xcmetrics.io): Spotify demos a dashboard tool that parses your team’s XCode build logs in order to track build times, error rates, and other productivity insights.
- And, of course, plenty of Q&A , including a discussion about the various methods for incorporating diagrams in TechDocs (iframes, PlantUML, GraphViz, Draw.io), where to find a list of currently supported TechDocs plugins and extensions, ideas for Backstage tutorials, and thoughts on how to track how much time people spend on a page inside Backstage.

Minutes of the meeting

- Our sixth official meetup is a special summer edition — with over 80 members of the community taking time out from backyards, patios, beaches, and idyllic Swedish summer cabins to dig deep into the latest Backstage features and updates.
- The new product roadmap is here! See what features and improvements the team is prioritizing this quarter. Feedbacks are welcome!
- [Mike](https://github.com/mtlewis) and [Himanshu](https://github.com/orkohunter) from Spotify walked through Scaffolder templating engine improvements.
- [Ruben](https://github.com/rubenLindstrom) from Spotify talked about composable homepages, including a live coding demo.
- Pallavi and Heather from [Splunk](https://www.splunk.com) gave us a peek into their Backstage portal. Internally known as “Pink Phonebook” — a uniquely branded name isn’t the only way the team customized Backstage to fit their engineering and tech culture.
- We celebrate standout contributions with our first Contributor Spotlight. (Spoiler alert: Congratulations, Dominik Henneke [@dhenneke](https://github.com/dhenneke)!)
- And finally, Q&A with the Backstage team about Golden Paths and more.

- Spotify won the CNCF Top End User Award. Thanks to the Backstage community. [Read more](https://www.cncf.io/announcements/2021/05/05/cloud-native-computing-foundation-grants-spotify-the-top-end-user-award/)
- TELUS Digial and ThoughtWorks share their Backstage adoption journey for their 8,000 engineers. They call their portal Simple — and it’s a beauty. Highlights:
  - The team envisions their portal as “the go-to place to find answers about development and delivery at TELUS, from getting to your first commit to reaching the right person, API, or tool.”
  - It will provide “self-serve onboarding for new team members and a one-stop shop for technical documentation.”
  - It will “enable reuse and findability for all their developers,” and allow developers to “create, manage, and evolve the technical health of everything they build.”
  - Backstage didn’t just allow TELUS to integrate their technology into the portal, but also their brand’s look and feel.
  - Material-UI and React components allowed the team to align with brand standards to present a seamless TELUS experience for their devs.
  - They built a custom plugin for Contentful, allowing them to incorporate the CMS they were already using.
  - Along with Contentful, they also integrated GitHub and Swiftype to create a unique TechDocs-like experience.
  - Anyone can write docs where and how they want — but now all that documentation is centralized and discoverable behind Backstage’s “single pane of glass.”
- Maintainers shared the work they have been doing on Software Catalog, to make it production ready by handling large scale deployments. Hear more from Johan ([@jhaals](https://github.com/jhaals)) and Fredrik ([@freben](https://github.com/freben)) in the recording.
- Raghu ([@soapraj](https://github.com/soapraj)), EM@Spotify gave a demo of the new Backstage homepage inside Spotify.
- Further questions and discussions from the community.

In our third official community meetup, online fashion platform Zalando shared what they learned on their journey to adopting Backstage. Watch to find out how a small internal team went from proof-of-concept to building a platform serving thousands of developers, including:

- Why Zalando decided to move away from their existing developer console and migrated to Backstage instead
- The value of providing your developers with one, centralized place for tooling, information, and resources
- The beauty of types and TypeScript
- The joys of being part of an open source community (bugs fixed before you even have time to report them!)
- The advantages of providing a platform that is composable, has shareable components, and is easy to build for
- The importance of taking a “trust-first” approach to collaboration

Thanks for the great presentation, Govind ([@GoWind](https://github.com/GoWind))!
