## FAQ

### How do I join a SIG?

Show up to the meetings! Other than the leadership, SIGs do not have a fixed membership list. Anyone with an interest can show up and join in on discussions. You can find the list of meetings in the README of each SIG.

### How can I get more insight into a SIG without joining?

Each SIG has a document where notes are added from the recurring meetings, this can provide insight into what is currently being discussed in the SIG. You will find this document in the SIG README. There’s also a Discord channel for each SIG.

### Why isn’t there a SIG for X?

We are currently in the process of introducing SIGs (May 2022) and want to start things off a bit carefully. Once initial SIGs have been spun up and there is a good pattern to replicate, there will likely be many more SIGs added to the list.

### Can I start a new SIG?

SIGs come with a fair bit of overhead and we would like to be very deliberate when introducing new SIGs as the concept is new and we’re actively iterating. It’s probably a better idea to request a specific channel on Discord but feel free to reach out to a maintainer if you have more questions.
