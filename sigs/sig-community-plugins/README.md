## Scope

This SIG is an open space to meet and discuss the setup and ongoing maintenance of the Backstage community plugins repo.

Discussions could for example cover what policies and checks to use in the repo, build tooling and structure, how to do issue triage and PR reviews. Discussions can also be more geared towards individual plugins, such as migrations in and out of the repo, or moving certain plugins in or out of active development.
